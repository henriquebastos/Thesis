***FOR VARIABLE SCOPE

a = 2

def f():
   print a

def g():
   a = 3
   print 3


GLOBAL:
a = 2

f:
a : Don't ever

g: a = 3


*** CLASSES ***
- class name --> class lines
Class scopes --> walk_ast.py line 118


- Executed Code box:
   + Ignore self variables
   - class instantiation should only say name of class, not returning output of the object
   + class instantiation should highlight the init method
   + class method calls need highlight fix

- Variable Box:
   - Object creation for class needs to be created
      - Class Name, Class variables, Class methods when called
   - Classes can have multiple instances
   - If object variable points to another object then variable box should merely indent that Node
      - Need a drawable section with arrows
      - Need better solution
      - For now, create objects that can't point to other objects

- IDEA: When hovering over a class/object, it displays the variables for that class/object


For code:
class Node():
   def __init__(self):
      self.value = None
      self.left = None
      self.right = None

   def set_value(self, v):
      self.value = v

   def get_value(self):
      return self.value

n = Node()

VARIABLE BOX (should be):
n = Node()
   Variables:
   - Node.value = 1
   - Node.left = None
   - Node.right = None
   Methods: (Only appear when called)
   - set_value:
      - v = 1
